“Sadlist” is a project that utilizes HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL to create a database of user-submitted suggestions for what to do when you’re sad. Users can shuffle through a set of suggestions, add their own, or view all suggestions in one table. Currently (as of August 2019), the project is hosted on a web server for the class, using an established database, and does not have any suggestions.

Project was created on PHP Storm and hosted with XAMPP.
